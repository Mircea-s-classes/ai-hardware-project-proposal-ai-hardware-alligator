# AI Hardware Project Proposal Template

## 1. Project Title
Team AI Alligator

Haizhou Yu, Kun Lu, Haochen Liu

Real Time Bird Sound Classifier. 

## 2. Platform Selection
Arduino Machine Learning Kit.

## 3. Problem Definition
In many environments, monitoring and identifying bird species is an important part of 
understanding nature, as well as fulfilling hobbies. However, not all people possess the ability to 
distinguish bird species from their sounds, making identifying bird sounds time-consuming and 
difficult to educators, hobbyists, and conservation groups with limited ability and resources. This 
project aims to develop a low-cost, small-size, real-time bird sound classification system using 
Tiny ML on the Arduino ML Kit. In addition, by embedding an on-device neural network which 
can be adaptable for bird song recognition directly from environmental audio. AI Alligator aims 
to demonstrate the system which enables continuous, low-power bird detection without cloud 
connectivity.

## 4. Technical Objectives
Accuracy goal - 95% & Reaction Time - <1s

## 5. Methodology
Hardware setup: Arduino ML kit, microphone & Software setup: CPP, training dataset (preferably existing from kaggle)
